# Kruskal's Algorithm Maze
This project was the final homework assignment for my Fundamentals of Computer Science II class at Northeastern University. The goal was to practice working with graphs and graph algorithms by designing mazes using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm to generate minimum spanning trees, and solve them using either breadth- or depth-first searches. We were also tasked with animating the search algorithms.

Below is an animation of the depth-first search in action on a randomly generated maze. The pink represents each "node" that the search visited and the orange represents the solution the search found.
